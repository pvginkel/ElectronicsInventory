# Code Review - Shopping List Overview V2 Phase 5

## Findings
- Implementation aligns with the phase 5 plan: done lists are locked from further edits, overview listings order by `updated_at`, and the `include_done` toggle is documented for the API. Guardrails consistently raise the refined `InvalidOperationException` messaging and the `_touch_list` propagation covers all mutating paths, so the overview timestamps and counters stay accurate.
- Unit and API coverage is thorough (service transitions, timestamp propagation, done-list gates, and data fixture updates), matching the testing requirements called out in the plan.

## Residual Risks / Follow-Ups
- None identified beyond routine regression coverage. No additional follow-up work suggested.

## Verification
- Manual review only (no tests executed as part of this review).
