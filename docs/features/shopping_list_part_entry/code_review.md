# Shopping List Part Entry – Code Review

## Findings
- [Medium] tests/test_parts_api.py:1169 – The plan requires duplicate prevention coverage at the API layer, but the new tests only verify success, concept-only rejection, and missing part handling. Add a regression that posts the same payload twice and asserts the second call returns the duplicate error (InvalidOperationException via 409). This keeps the endpoint aligned with the plan and protects the central duplicate-prevention path.

## Open Questions
- None.

## Summary
- Service and schema changes match the Phase 3 plan, and the membership query behaves as expected in service tests. Please add the missing API duplicate scenario before merge.
