# Code Review: Standardize Foreign Keys to Use Surrogate Primary Keys

## Implementation Status: ✅ CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED

The plan for standardizing foreign keys has been **correctly and completely implemented**. All requirements from the plan have been fulfilled.

## Review Findings

### ✅ Plan Implementation Compliance

**Database Migration (003_create_parts_tables.py):**
- ✅ Parts table uses `key` field (not `id4`) - Line 34
- ✅ PartLocation uses `part_id` (integer) with FK to `parts.id` - Lines 51, 60
- ✅ QuantityHistory uses `part_id` (integer) with FK to `parts.id` - Lines 68, 72
- ✅ All foreign key constraints reference surrogate keys (`parts.id`)
- ✅ Proper indexes created with correct field names - Lines 77, 79, 81

**Model Changes:**
- ✅ Part model: `key: Mapped[str]` field correctly defined (part.py:24)
- ✅ PartLocation model: `part_id: Mapped[int]` with FK to `parts.id` (part_location.py:26-28)
- ✅ QuantityHistory model: `part_id: Mapped[int]` with FK to `parts.id` (quantity_history.py:21-23)
- ✅ All relationships properly configured with surrogate key references
- ✅ Proper `__repr__` methods updated to use new field names

### ✅ No Implementation Issues Found

**Database Normalization:**
- Foreign keys correctly reference surrogate primary keys (`parts.id`)
- Natural key (`key`) is separate from foreign key relationships
- All constraints and indexes use proper field names

**Code Quality:**
- No remaining references to old field names (`id4`, `part_id4`) in codebase
- Models follow established patterns and type hints
- Relationships configured with proper lazy loading and cascades

**Test Data Compatibility:**
- Test data files use `part_key` field correctly
- JSON structure aligns with new schema requirements
- Data loading will work properly with surrogate key relationships

### ✅ Architecture Compliance

**Follows Project Patterns:**
- SQLAlchemy models use proper type hints with `Mapped[Type]`
- Foreign key relationships configured correctly
- Cascade settings appropriate for owned entities
- Proper use of `selectin` lazy loading for relationships

**Database Best Practices:**
- Surrogate keys for all foreign key relationships ✅
- Natural key preserved as `key` field for business logic ✅
- Proper constraints and indexes ✅
- No performance concerns identified ✅

## Summary

The foreign key standardization has been **perfectly implemented** according to the plan:

1. **Database schema**: All foreign keys reference `parts.id` (surrogate key)
2. **Natural key**: Renamed from `id4` to `key` for better semantics
3. **Models**: All use proper integer foreign keys to `parts.id`
4. **No legacy references**: Clean codebase with no old field names
5. **Test compatibility**: Data structures align with new schema

**No issues or improvements needed** - the implementation is ready for production use.
