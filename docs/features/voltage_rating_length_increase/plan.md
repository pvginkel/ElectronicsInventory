# Technical Plan: Increase Voltage Rating Field Length to 100 Characters

## Brief Description

The current `voltage_rating` field in the Part model has a maximum length of 50 characters. This plan increases the field length to 100 characters to accommodate longer, more complex voltage specifications like "3V-40V input, 1.5V-35V output" and other detailed voltage requirements.

## Files and Functions to Modify

### Database Layer

**File: `app/models/part.py`**
- **Line 54**: Update `voltage_rating` field definition from `String(50)` to `String(100)`

### Database Migration

**New file: `alembic/versions/006_increase_voltage_rating_length.py`**
- Create new migration to alter column length from 50 to 100 characters
- Include both upgrade and downgrade functions
- Migration will use `ALTER TABLE parts ALTER COLUMN voltage_rating TYPE VARCHAR(100)`

### Test Data Updates

**File: `app/data/test_data/parts.json`**
- Review existing voltage_rating values to ensure they remain valid
- Current longest value appears to be: "3V-40V input, 1.5V-35V output" (34 characters)
- No changes needed as all current values are under 100 characters

### Service Layer (No Changes Required)

**File: `app/services/part_service.py`**
- No changes needed - service layer doesn't enforce string length constraints

### API/Schema Layer (No Changes Required)

**Files: `app/schemas/part.py`, `app/schemas/ai_part_analysis.py`**
- Pydantic schemas don't specify string length constraints for voltage_rating
- No changes needed as validation is handled at the database level

### Test Updates (No Changes Required)

**Files: `tests/test_part_service.py`, `tests/test_parts_api.py`, `tests/test_ai_parts_api.py`**
- No changes needed - existing tests will continue to work with the increased field length

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Changes
1. Create new Alembic migration file `006_increase_voltage_rating_length.py`
2. Update Part model field definition to `String(100)`
3. Run migration to update database schema

### Phase 2: Validation
1. Verify that existing test data loads correctly after migration
2. Test AI service can handle longer voltage ratings
3. Confirm API endpoints accept and return longer voltage rating values

## Technical Considerations

- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing data will remain valid as we're only increasing the maximum length
- **Database Performance**: Index on voltage_rating field will continue to work efficiently
- **Storage Impact**: Minimal increase in storage requirements as PostgreSQL VARCHAR columns only store actual string length plus overhead
- **Application Logic**: No business logic changes required as the field is treated as a simple string throughout the application

## Test Strategy

- **Integration Tests**: Ensure API endpoints handle longer values correctly  
- **Migration Tests**: Confirm migration runs successfully and preserves existing data
