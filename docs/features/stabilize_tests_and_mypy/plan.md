**Brief Description**
Address the regression where the last test run emitted 207 warnings (notably PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning for the `/api/testing/logs/stream` SSE generator and multiple `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings) and `poetry run mypy .` currently fails with a `Field` overload error in `app/schemas/testing.py` followed by an assertion crash (`Cannot find component 'TraversibleType' for 'sqlalchemy.sql.visitors.TraversibleType'`).

**Relevant Files and Functions**
- `app/api/testing.py:stream_logs` – generator powering the `/api/testing/logs/stream` SSE endpoint that currently yields after `GeneratorExit` and trips PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning.
- `app/utils/sse_utils.py:create_sse_response`, `app/utils/log_capture.py:LogCaptureHandler` – confirm handshake sequencing still matches expectations once the stream cleanup changes.
- `app/services/shopping_list_service.py:_touch_list`, `app/services/shopping_list_service.py:upsert_seller_note` – timestamp updates to replace deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` calls.
- `app/services/shopping_list_line_service.py:_touch_list` and `complete_line` flow – same replacement requirement.
- `app/schemas/task_schema.py:TaskEvent.timestamp` – default factory needs to call `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` instead of `datetime.utcnow`.
- `app/schemas/testing.py` (all schema classes) – each `Field(..., example=...)` call violates the Pydantic v2 typing expectations flagged by mypy.
- `tests/api/test_testing.py`, `tests/services/test_shopping_list_service.py`, `tests/test_parts_api.py` – adjust expectations and fixtures that currently rely on `datetime.utcnow()` so they stay aligned with the new API usage.
- `pyproject.toml` / dependency management – track the typing dependency upgrade or configuration change required to stop mypy from crashing on `sqlalchemy.sql.visitors.TraversibleType`.

**Implementation Plan**
_Phase 1 – Stabilize SSE log streaming generator_
- Restructure `stream_logs` so the generator drains a sentinel close event before exit: enqueue `("connection_close", {...})` onto `event_queue` and break the main loop cleanly, letting the normal yield path emit the close message without touching the teardown block.
- Set a shutdown flag before unregistering the client to prevent the loop from waiting on new events after the sentinel has been processed.
- Keep the `finally` block focused on unregistering the client and clearing resources—no yields after `GeneratorExit`—and cover the handshake by ensuring `LogCaptureHandler.unregister_client` is still paired with the sentinel emission.
- Verify `create_sse_response` usage stays unchanged and that tests expecting `connection_open`/`heartbeat` semantics still pass without warnings.

_Phase 2 – Update UTC timestamp calls_
- Replace every direct `datetime.utcnow()` call in shopping-list services and `TaskEvent.timestamp` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` so the code uses the modern API without introducing additional abstractions.
- Review call sites that persist or compare these timestamps to confirm ORM interactions remain valid; adjust tests (`tests/services/test_shopping_list_service.py`, `tests/test_parts_api.py`) to assert against the timezone-aware values returned by the new API or normalize before comparison where needed.

_Phase 3 – Repair mypy type failures_
- Replace every `example=` argument in `app/schemas/testing.py` with the Pydantic v2-compatible `examples=[...]` signature to satisfy the `Field` overload mypy enforces.
- Pin the project to an SQLAlchemy typing helper (`sqlalchemy2-stubs` version compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.0.43) by adding it to `pyproject.toml` and re-locking; this removes the `TraversibleType` assertion crash.
- Run `poetry update sqlalchemy2-stubs` (or `poetry add --group dev sqlalchemy2-stubs==<version>`) and regenerate `poetry.lock`; confirm the new stub version resolves the mypy crash.

**Testing Strategy**
- `poetry run pytest tests/api/test_testing.py tests/services/test_shopping_list_service.py tests/test_parts_api.py` to exercise the modified SSE workflow and timestamp-dependent logic quickly.
- `poetry run pytest` for a full regression sweep once targeted suites are green and the warning count drops.
- `poetry run mypy .` to confirm the typing fixes and stub alignment resolve the original failures.
