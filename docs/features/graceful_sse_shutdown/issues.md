Concerning this code:

        if hasattr(task_service, '_executor') and task_service._executor._shutdown:
            logger.debug("Readiness check failed: task service executor is shutdown")
            return Response("task service unhealthy", status=503, mimetype='text/plain')

I prefer an approach that does not depend on the internal implementation of the service.

Thinking through this, I don't get why the task service is special. Aren't there other services that could contribute in a healthy status of the app? Please remove the check completely.

/drain route should get an auth key.

This code should not be necessary:

                # Check if shutdown was requested during wait
                if self._shutdown_event.is_set():
                    break

Please double check.

TaskService.shutdown should not set draining state. It's not correct semantically.

Please remove the logic in GracefulShutdownManager that works around the class being instantiated multiple times. So, I do appreciate that especially when unit testing it's not going to be ideal if many instances are created. Maybe we take a different approach. Lets inject the instance just like we do for the config and sessionmaker and have main instantiate the class. For unit testing we can use a Noop version like NoopMetricsService.
