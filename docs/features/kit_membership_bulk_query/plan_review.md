### 1) Summary & Decision
**Readiness**
The plan skips the required Consistency/Transactions analysis and substitutes `### 7) Error Handling`, so we never define transaction scope, atomicity, or retry handling for the new bulk queries (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:152-160`, contradicted by `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:136-165`). The Derived State section also omits guards, invariants, and evidence lines (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:142-150`) that the template mandates (`docs/commands/plan_feature.md:121-132`). Together these gaps leave core durability and correctness concerns unspecified.

**Decision**
`NO-GO` — Missing template-mandated sections and evidence prevents implementers from knowing how to keep the new bulk lookups safe and observable.

### 2) Conformance & Fit (with evidence)
**Conformance to refs**
- `docs/commands/plan_feature.md` — Fail — `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:152-160` — Replaces required Consistency template with ad-hoc error notes, leaving transaction guidance undefined.
- `docs/commands/plan_feature.md` — Fail — `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:142-150` — Derived-value entries miss the mandated Guards/Invariant/Evidence bullets.

**Fit with codebase**
- `app/services/kit_service.py` bulk resolver — `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:37-39` — Plan adds a multi-kit helper but later test coverage never exercises it (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:176-206`), risking regressions in kit resolution.
- Metrics integration — `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:162-165` — Plan assumes existing counters will apply but cites none of the actual instrumentation in `app/services/metrics_service.py`, leaving monitoring expectations unclear.

### 3) Open Questions & Ambiguities
- Question: What session/transaction scope will the bulk services use to keep kit, shopping-list, and pick-list reads consistent?  
  Why it matters: Without defining commit/rollback behaviour, we cannot guarantee atomicity or safe retries for batched lookups.  
  Needed answer: Specify the Consistency template entries (transaction scope, atomic requirements, idempotency, ordering) per `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:136-149`.
- Question: Which metrics/logs should fire for the new endpoints?  
  Why it matters: Plan states “No new metrics” yet hints at `record_pick_list_list_request` without documenting when/how it triggers, risking blind spots.  
  Needed answer: Fill the Observability template with concrete metric names, triggers, and evidence (`docs/commands/plan_feature.md:167-181`).

### 4) Deterministic Backend Coverage
- Behavior: `KitService` bulk kit resolver  
  - Scenarios: Not listed; plan only covers shopping-list and pick-list service helpers (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:176-206`).  
  - Instrumentation: None specified.  
  - Persistence hooks: Needs assurance that bulk resolver interacts safely with session injection.  
  - Gaps: Add Given/When/Then scenarios covering order preservation, missing IDs, and hard caps for the resolver itself.  
  - Evidence: `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:37-39`.
- Behavior: `KitShoppingListService.list_links_for_kits_bulk`  
  - Scenarios: Order preservation, empty kits, include_done, unknown kit (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:176-183`).  
  - Instrumentation: Unspecified; no metrics/logging coverage.  
  - Persistence hooks: Needs clarity on query batching and session usage.  
  - Gaps: Document instrumentation expectations and session handling.  
  - Evidence: `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:40-44`.
- Behavior: `POST /api/kits/pick-list-memberships/query`  
  - Scenarios: Order, validation errors, include_done toggle (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:191-205`).  
  - Instrumentation: None described.  
  - Persistence hooks: No mention of schema validation wiring or DI evidence.  
  - Gaps: Specify Spectree schema wiring evidence and metrics/log coverage.  
  - Evidence: `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:35-45`.

### 5) Adversarial Sweep
**Blocker — Missing Consistency Template**
**Evidence:** `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:152-160`; `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:136-165` — Consistency section is absent, so transaction scope, atomic writes, retry, and ordering rules are undefined.  
**Why it matters:** Bulk lookups span multiple tables; without documenting session boundaries we risk inconsistent reads and brittle retry behaviour.  
**Fix suggestion:** Restore section 7 using `<consistency_template>` to spell out session handling, atomicity (e.g., all-kit resolution happens before membership queries), and ordering guarantees.  
**Confidence:** High

**Major — Derived State Entries Incomplete**
**Evidence:** `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:142-150`; `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:121-132` — Derived values omit Guards, Invariants, and Evidence lines.  
**Why it matters:** Without explicit invariants/guards, implementers may skip enforcing order preservation or stale-link recalculation, causing incorrect badges.  
**Fix suggestion:** Populate each derived entry with guards (e.g., `selectinload` enforcement), invariants (request order equality), and cite supporting code paths.  
**Confidence:** High

**Major — Observability Plan Undefined**
**Evidence:** `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:162-165`; `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:167-181` — Section 9 states “No new metrics” but provides no signal definitions, triggers, or evidence.  
**Why it matters:** Bulk endpoints introduce new traffic patterns; without documented instrumentation we risk zero visibility into success/error rates.  
**Fix suggestion:** Enumerate counters/Histograms (e.g., reuse or extend metrics in `app/services/metrics_service.py`) with trigger points and evidence.  
**Confidence:** Medium

**Major — Test Plan Misses Kit Resolver**
**Evidence:** `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:176-206`; `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:37-39` — Plan adds a new `kit_service` helper but the Deterministic Test Plan lacks scenarios covering it.  
**Why it matters:** Bulk resolver is the gatekeeper for kit IDs; without direct tests we could regress duplicate handling or 404 semantics.  
**Fix suggestion:** Add Given/When/Then coverage for the resolver (valid set, unknown kit, limit enforcement) and cite the future test module.  
**Confidence:** High

### 6) Derived-Value & Persistence Invariants
- Derived value: `KitShoppingListLink.is_stale`  
  - Source dataset: Compares `snapshot_kit_updated_at` to kit `updated_at` during metadata hydration (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:142-144`).  
  - Write / cleanup triggered: Drives badge freshness shown in bulk responses; no persistence write but influences cached state.  
  - Guards: Need explicit assertion that `_hydrate_link_metadata` runs during bulk fetch and that session eager-loading is enforced.  
  - Invariant: Bulk payload must mirror single-kit stale detection semantics.  
  - Evidence: `app/models/kit_shopping_list_link.py:30-70`.
- Derived value: Pick-list counters (`line_count`, `remaining_quantity`)  
  - Source dataset: Computed fields on `KitPickList` requiring `lines` relationship to be loaded (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:145-147`).  
  - Write / cleanup triggered: Returned counters inform UI badges; stale or partial loads misrepresent remaining work.  
  - Guards: Require `selectinload(KitPickList.lines)` in bulk query and assert no lazy loads during serialization.  
  - Invariant: Counter totals in bulk response equal per-kit detail endpoint values.  
  - Evidence: `app/models/kit_pick_list.py:116-192`.
- Derived value: Response ordering  
  - Source dataset: Input `kit_ids` list determines grouping order (`docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:148-150`).  
  - Write / cleanup triggered: Output order drives clients’ UI alignment; losing order breaks badge mapping.  
  - Guards: Maintain ordered mapping keyed to the original ID sequence before serialization.  
  - Invariant: For every index `i`, response.memberships[i].kit_id == request.kit_ids[i].  
  - Evidence: `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:148-150`.

### 7) Risks & Mitigations (top 3)
- Risk: Absent transaction guidance allows inconsistent multi-kit reads when memberships mutate mid-request.  
  - Mitigation: Document session scope and sequencing per Consistency template.  
  - Evidence: `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:152-160`.
- Risk: Derived value guardrails not spelled out may lead to stale badge calculations.  
  - Mitigation: Expand Section 6 with guards/invariants tied to eager-loading strategies.  
  - Evidence: `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:142-150`.
- Risk: Monitoring blind spots because observability is “none”.  
  - Mitigation: Specify metrics/logs (or explicitly justify reuse) referencing MetricsService.  
  - Evidence: `docs/features/kit_membership_bulk_query/plan.md:162-165`.

### 8) Confidence
Confidence: Low — Template deviations and missing instrumentation/test guidance leave too many unknowns for implementation.
