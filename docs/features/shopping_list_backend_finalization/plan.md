# Shopping List Backend Finalization Plan

## Brief Description
- Confirm that all backend requirements from `docs/epics/shopping_list_brief.md` and phases 1–5, 3, 4, and 7 in `docs/epics/shopping_list_phases.md` are already satisfied, while explicitly excluding the project-to-list bridge (Phase 6) per request.
- Document that no additional backend implementation work is needed before UI development begins.

## Files to Create or Modify
- None; existing modules (`app/services/shopping_list_service.py`, `app/services/shopping_list_line_service.py`, related schemas, models, APIs, tests, and fixtures) already implement the required behaviour and guards, including Phase 7 timestamp polish.

## Algorithms
- Not applicable—no new logic is planned because the current implementation already covers the required flows, guards, and timestamps.

## Validation Checklist
- Run `poetry run pytest`, `poetry run mypy`, and `poetry run ruff check .` to reconfirm the backend remains green before UI integration work starts.
