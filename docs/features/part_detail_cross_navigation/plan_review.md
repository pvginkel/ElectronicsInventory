### 1) Summary & Decision
**Readiness**
The plan identifies the right touchpoints but omits mandatory template content for derived invariants, transactional scope, and error handling, leaving core guardrails undefined (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:119-138` — lines titled “Derived value...” / “Validation & Error Handling”; `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:121-165` — template requirements for sections 6–8).

**Decision**
`NO-GO` — Required sections 6–8 do not follow `docs/commands/plan_feature.md`, so the implementation lacks vetted invariants, transaction scopes, and error coverage.

### 2) Conformance & Fit (with evidence)
**Conformance to refs**
- `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:125-132` — Fail — `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:119-128` — “- Derived value: reserved_quantity ... Writes / cleanup...” (no Guards/Invariants/Evidence despite template).
- `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:136-149` — Fail — `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:130-133` — Heading “### 7) Validation & Error Handling” replaces required Consistency template.
- `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:152-165` — Fail — `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:135-138` — Section “### 8) Performance & Scaling” appears where Errors & Edge Cases must be logged.

**Fit with codebase**
- `app/schemas/part.py` — `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:43-45` — Plan assumes `PartResponseSchema` can expose `id`; must confirm model already pulls `id` or extend ORM projection.
- `app/services/kit_reservation_service.py` — `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:204-207` — Cache invalidation risk noted but no mitigation path specified for existing `_usage_cache`.
- `app/api/parts.py` — `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:41-42` — New `/parts/<int:part_id>/kits` endpoint depends on Part IDs being available to callers; current API returns only part key.

### 3) Open Questions & Ambiguities
- Question: How will clients obtain `part_id` to call `/parts/<int:part_id>/kits`? (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:34`, `207-209`)
  - Why it matters: Without a reliable identifier, the new endpoint is unusable.
  - Needed answer: Confirm `PartResponseSchema` will expose the numeric id or adjust endpoint to key-based routing.
- Question: Should the usage payload include `required_per_unit` alongside reserved quantity? (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:213-215`)
  - Why it matters: Missing data could block planned frontend tooltips.
  - Needed answer: Decide whether to extend schema or confirm omission is acceptable.

### 4) Deterministic Backend Coverage (new/changed behavior only)
- Behavior: `KitReservationService.list_kits_for_part`
  - Scenarios:
    - Given a part with active and archived kits, When listing usage, Then only active kits emerge with totals (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:166-169`).
    - Given a part without kits, When listing usage, Then an empty list returns (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:168-170`).
  - Instrumentation: None at service level; relies on API counter (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:141-145`).
  - Persistence hooks: No schema change; cached data reuse only (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:30`, `204-207`).
  - Gaps: Guarded cache invalidation test path unspecified.
  - Evidence: `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:166-172`.
- Behavior: `GET /parts/<int:part_id>/kits`
  - Scenarios:
    - Given an existing part with active kits, When requesting usage, Then schema list plus counter increment (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:173-176`).
    - Given no kits, When requesting usage, Then 200 with empty list and `has_results=false` label (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:176-177`, `141-145`).
    - Given missing part id, When requesting usage, Then 404 (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:177-178`).
  - Instrumentation: `part_kit_usage_requests_total` counter with `has_results` label (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:141-145`).
  - Persistence hooks: None cited; relies on existing tables (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:29-30`).
  - Gaps: Metric emission success/failure paths not covered by tests.
  - Evidence: `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:173-180`.
- Behavior: `GET /parts/<string:part_key>`
  - Scenarios:
    - Given kit usage, When fetching part detail, Then `used_in_kits` true (and `id` present if added) (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:181-184`).
    - Given no usage, When fetching, Then `used_in_kits` false (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:184-185`).
  - Instrumentation: None beyond existing part detail metrics.
  - Persistence hooks: Response-only flag; no writes (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:123-125`).
  - Gaps: Test plan does not assert metric side effects or cache coherence.
  - Evidence: `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:181-187`.

### 5) Adversarial Sweep (must find ≥3 credible issues or declare why none exist)
**Major — Missing derived-state guards**
**Evidence:** `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:125-132`; `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:119-128` — “- Derived value: reserved_quantity ... Writes / cleanup...” (no Guards/Invariants/Evidence).
**Why it matters:** Without the required guard/invariant detail, reviewers cannot verify cache safety or filtered-write protections.
**Fix suggestion:** Expand section 6 with Guard, Invariant, and Evidence fields per template, citing actual code points.
**Confidence:** High

**Major — Consistency section omitted**
**Evidence:** `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:136-149`; `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:130-133` — Heading “### 7) Validation & Error Handling...” supplies bullets unrelated to transaction scope.
**Why it matters:** Concurrency assumptions (cache reuse, session lifecycle) remain undocumented, risking stale reads and partial writes.
**Fix suggestion:** Replace section 7 with the required Consistency template covering unit-of-work, atomic updates, retries, and ordering.
**Confidence:** High

**Major — Errors & edge cases missing**
**Evidence:** `docs/commands/plan_feature.md:152-165`; `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:135-138` — “### 8) Performance & Scaling...” appears in place of required failure handling.
**Why it matters:** Without enumerated failure surfaces (metrics failures, cache misses, invalid ids), implementers lack guidance on API responses and guardrails.
**Fix suggestion:** Add section 8 using the error-case template, covering invalid IDs, empty usage, cache eviction failures, and metric errors.
**Confidence:** High

### 6) Derived-Value & Persistence Invariants (stacked entries)
- Derived value: reserved_quantity
  - Source dataset: Active kit contents multiplication described in `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:121-122`.
  - Write / cleanup triggered: Response projection only; cache reuse noted (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:122`).
  - Guards: Not specified; needs cache invalidation guard per template.
  - Invariant: Reserved totals must match active kits; unstated.
  - Evidence: `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:121-122`.
- Derived value: used_in_kits
  - Source dataset: Boolean from usage list length (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:123-124`).
  - Write / cleanup triggered: Adds transient attribute before schema dump (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:125`).
  - Guards: None described; should assert list excludes archived kits.
  - Invariant: Flag true iff list non-empty; not declared.
  - Evidence: `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:123-125`.
- Derived value: kit_usage_list_sorted
  - Source dataset: Sorted service output (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:126-127`).
  - Write / cleanup triggered: Deterministic response ordering, cached until refreshed (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:128`).
  - Guards: Absent; must ensure cache invalidation on kit rename.
  - Invariant: Order must remain deterministic across requests; unstated.
  - Evidence: `docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:126-128`.

### 7) Risks & Mitigations (top 3)
- Risk: Cache invalidation could leave stale `used_in_kits` data (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:204-206`)
  - Mitigation: Document bypass or invalidation hook (needs plan addition).
- Risk: Part detail payload may lack `id`, blocking new endpoint (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:207-209`)
  - Mitigation: Commit to exposing id or changing endpoint signature.
- Risk: Metric proliferation without dashboards (`docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:210-212`)
  - Mitigation: Coordinate with ops or justify metric usage.

### 8) Confidence
Confidence: Low — Missing template sections leave transactional and error-handling behavior undefined.
