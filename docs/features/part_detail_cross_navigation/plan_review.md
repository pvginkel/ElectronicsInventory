### 1) Summary & Decision
**Readiness**
The plan cleanly maps spec requirements to code touch points—service helper, schemas, API route, metrics, and tests (docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:36-210)—and cites the updated cross-navigation spec (docs/epics/kits_feature_breakdown.md:203-213), keeping work within service/API boundaries and providing explicit risk callouts.

**Decision**
`GO` — Scope, contracts, and coverage are aligned with the clarified spec; residual risks are documented and manageable.

### 2) Conformance & Fit (with evidence)
**Conformance to refs**
- `docs/epics/kits_feature_breakdown.md` — Pass — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:40-99 — “Introduce new `/parts/<string:part_key>/kits` route… PartKitUsageSchema…” matches the updated spec (`required_per_unit`, string keys).
- Electronics Inventory Backend Guidelines — Pass — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:36-60 — Changes live in services, schemas, and APIs with tests, honoring the layered architecture.

**Fit with codebase**
- `KitReservationService` — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:37-48 — Reuses existing cache/query helper, minimizing new logic.
- `app/api/parts.py` — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:40-57,196-210 — Adds a sibling endpoint alongside existing part routes with matching dependency-injection pattern.
- `MetricsService` — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:49-60,164-168 — Extends established counter patterns, so instrumentation fits current design.

### 3) Open Questions & Ambiguities
- Question: Are additional per-kit annotations (notes, due dates) required with `required_per_unit`?
  - Why it matters: Tooltip usefulness depends on the payload breadth.
  - Needed answer: UX confirmation on desired fields (docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:236-238).
- Question: Should backend emit navigation URLs or let the frontend derive them?
  - Why it matters: Determines whether URL construction is centralized.
  - Needed answer: Frontend preference during implementation (docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:239-241).

### 4) Deterministic Backend Coverage (new/changed behavior only)
- Behavior: `KitReservationService.list_kits_for_part`
  - Scenarios:
    - Given active + archived kits, When listing usage, Then only active kits remain (`tests/services/test_kit_reservation_service.py::…`) — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:189-195.
    - Given no kits, When listing, Then empty list returns (`tests/services/test_kit_reservation_service.py::…`) — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:189-195.
  - Instrumentation: None (service-level); endpoint counter covers API usage — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:164-168.
  - Persistence hooks: Existing tables reused; no migrations — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:36-55,62-87.
  - Gaps: None noted.
  - Evidence: docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:189-195.
- Behavior: `GET /parts/<string:part_key>/kits`
  - Scenarios:
    - Given active kits, When calling endpoint, Then payload matches schema incl. `required_per_unit` and metric increments (`tests/api/test_parts_api.py::…`) — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:196-203.
    - Given no kits, When calling, Then 200 + empty list + `has_results="false"` label — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:196-203.
    - Given unknown key, When calling, Then 404 — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:196-203.
  - Instrumentation: `part_kit_usage_requests_total` counter with `has_results` label — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:164-168.
  - Persistence hooks: None (read-only); DI wiring handled via existing provider — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:40-57.
  - Gaps: None.
  - Evidence: docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:89-99,164-168,196-203.
- Behavior: `GET /parts/<string:part_key>` (augmented)
  - Scenarios:
    - Given kits consume part, When fetching detail, Then `used_in_kits=True`.
    - Given no kits, Then `used_in_kits=False` — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:204-210.
  - Instrumentation: None beyond existing logs; relies on service computations — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:89-99,164-168.
  - Persistence hooks: N/A (response-only flag) — docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:62-87.
  - Gaps: None.
  - Evidence: docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:204-210.

### 5) Adversarial Sweep (must find ≥3 credible issues or declare why none exist)
- Checks attempted: Contract alignment (string keys, payload fields), cache invalidation expectations, metrics instrumentation, coverage completeness.
- Evidence: docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:37-60,89-168,189-210; docs/epics/kits_feature_breakdown.md:203-213.
- Why the plan holds: Clarified spec now matches plan (string keys + `required_per_unit`), caching relies on request-scoped service instances, and every behavior has explicit tests + metrics, so no credible blockers remain.

### 7) Risks & Mitigations (top 3)
- Risk: Large fan-out parts could slow query performance.
  - Mitigation: Benchmark and add supporting indexes if needed.
  - Evidence: docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:226-229.
- Risk: Part key normalization errors could lead to 404s.
  - Mitigation: Reuse existing key normalization helpers.
  - Evidence: docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:230-232.
- Risk: New metric may lack operational consumers.
  - Mitigation: Coordinate dashboard/alert updates alongside release.
  - Evidence: docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:233-235.

### 8) Confidence
Confidence: Medium — Plan is grounded in current architecture with clear coverage, and remaining uncertainty is limited to UX payload breadth and performance tuning (docs/features/part_detail_cross_navigation/plan.md:164-168,226-241,243-244).
