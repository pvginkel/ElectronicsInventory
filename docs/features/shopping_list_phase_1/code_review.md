# Shopping List Phase 1 Code Review

## Findings

- No blocking issues identified. The implementation matches the plan and tests cover the service and API behaviors, including duplicate safeguards and status validation.

## Observations

- `ShoppingListLineService` no longer injects the unused `part_service`; the dependency has been removed (`app/services/shopping_list_line_service.py`).
- Both shopping list blueprints now share a common boolean query parsing helper provided by `app/utils/request_parsing.py`.
