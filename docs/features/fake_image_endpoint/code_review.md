# Code Review â€“ Fake Image Endpoint

## Findings
- None. Prior font-loading failure was resolved by switching to `ImageFont.load_default()`.

## Plan Check
- The plan steps were followed: route was added under the testing blueprint, image generation lives in the service layer, HTTP caching headers are set, and tests cover success, validation, and non-testing mode scenarios.
